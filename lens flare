Assume:

 - the filter has already been tiled, with each (pre-FFT'd) tile in its own texture.

Break up the input signal (i.e. the raw render) into tiles, starting from the bottom-left.

For each filter tile, figure out the offset that the convolved signal will need to be shifted by
prior to placing it into the convolution buffer.

When placing a tile in the signal tile:

 - clip the viewport to the area of the signal the tile actually covers

Do the same for the convolution buffer...
